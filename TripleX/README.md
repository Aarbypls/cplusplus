# TripleX

TripleX is a very simple game developed in C++ and played in the terminal. 

## Description

The player advances through 5 levels of difficulty, having to guess the correct three numbers in order to advance.
You are given hints based on the sum and product of the three numbers.

Ex:
* The codes add up to: 12
* The codes multiply to give: 64

Correct answer: 6 4 2

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Simply run the application. Press CTRL-C at any time to quit.
There's no lose condition - failing a puzzle will simply allow you to retry the level.
You win after solving 5 sequential puzzles.
