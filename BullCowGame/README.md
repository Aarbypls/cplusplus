# Bulls and Cows

Bulls and Cows is a very simple game developed using C++; with a graphical and in-game component, but mostly played through the terminal.

## Description

The player controls an avatar that can walk around a simple environment, but the gameplay is done by using the terminal text on the sign in front of the player.
The terminal can be used by pressing TAB, and can be interacted with by typing commands and pressing ENTER.

The gameplay of Bulls and Cows is simple - the terminal will show the player a hint about a word to guess, and the player will have to guess it.
The player will have a number of lives equal to the length of the word, and will receive "Bulls" and "Cows" based on how close their guess was.
Bulls: The right letter is in the right spot.
Cows: The right letter is in the wrong spot.

Additionally, the words being guessed are isograms, meaning they do not repeat any letters. (Ex: "GIANT")

Ex:
* Hidden Word: "WIFE"
* Player's Guess: "FATE"
* Bulls: 1 (for the letter E in the right spot)
* Cows: 1 (for the letter F is the wrong spot)

## Getting Started

### Executing program

The code here has simply been added to show usage of C++, and thus cannot be executed. If you'd like to see an example the game in action, you can view videos by checking out the Udemy tutorial referenced below.
