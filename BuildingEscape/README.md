# Building Escape

Building Escape is a very simple demo / test scene for 3D development in Unreal. "Escape" the room to win.

## Description

The scene was created in order to test basic scripting in Unreal; all of the functionality of the scene has been scripted in C++. 

Building Escape uses the following concepts, all on a VERY basic level:
	* Lighting
	* Materials and Textures
	* Trigger & Collision Volumes
	* Raycasting
	* Audio & Physics Components

The right mouse button is used for picking up objects in the scene, which is necessary to complete the small puzzle.
